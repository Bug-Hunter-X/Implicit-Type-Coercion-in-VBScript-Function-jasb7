This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to implicit variable typing. The `bug.vbs` file contains a function that lacks explicit type declarations for its parameters and result, leading to potential type-related errors. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version with explicit type declarations to prevent these errors.  Understanding explicit typing is crucial for robust VBScript development.
